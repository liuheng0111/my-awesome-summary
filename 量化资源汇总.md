- [GNOIMI](https://github.com/arbabenko/GNOIMI)
- [pstrees](https://github.com/arbabenko/pstrees) The implementation of the Product Split Trees structure from the paper "Product Split Trees", CVPR 2017.train.py - learns a large set of discriminative splitting directions in the product form Search part - coming soon
- [py-inverted-index](https://github.com/imatge-upc/retrieval-2016-icmr/tree/master/lib/py-inverted-index), Fast in-memory inverted index.
- [Multi Index Hashing](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~norouzi/research/mih/) for fast exact nearest neighbor search in Hamming distance on binary codes. By using this code, one can reproduce most of the results explained in the paper on 1 billion and 80 million datasets. This implementation improves the storage efficiency of our previous implementation described in the paper by utilizing sparse hash tables.You can download the latest version of our code from [github.com/norouzi/mih](https://github.com/norouzi/mih).
